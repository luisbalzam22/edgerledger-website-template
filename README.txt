My very first web project, The EdegerLedger:
The EdegerLedger is a very basic, yet elegant, single-page HTML template, designed to target banking-related companies and businesses. 
For this simple project I decided to offer only two views: mobile/tablet and desktop; its structure contains the most semantical and minimaistic HTML markup, perfect por a landing page such as this one.

Technologies /Fameworks Included In the project:
- HTML
- CSS
- Fontawesome 5
- Jquery (v3.4.1)
